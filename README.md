# Case_studies

Here I experimented with 3 different cases of using data:
  -  Visualising data hotspots for coral bleaching on a world map using longitude and latitude
  -  Wrote my own 2 cases of cross validation and compared them
  -  Identifying eye movemnts using wave files under streaming conditions
The html file is a report that was rendered from R
